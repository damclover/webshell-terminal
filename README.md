# 🛠️ Web-Shell Terminal by DamClover

A simple yet powerful PHP-based web shell that simulates a terminal, providing a secure command execution interface. The web shell uses a password-based system, and the password is **nothingissecure**. This tool is designed for educational purposes only.

### - Just upload the shell on a web target
The password is `nothingissecure`

### 🚨 Warning

This **Web-Shell Terminal** is intended for **educational purposes only**. Do not use it in unauthorized systems. Always ensure that you have explicit permission before testing or using any web shell on a target.

If you use the `/ultraface` command the webshell will corrupt all .php and .html files, be careful :3 
PS. Only use with .php7 IF u want to use the `/ultraface`
